I absolutely love the first image I commissioned from Yuteke of the pouting Tenka, but I normally don't like sending repeated requests to artists.  Tenka comes from a hentai so she's not exactly a well known or popular character, so it feels a bit weird trying to request art of her. 

After I made that Tweet asking for Skeb appeals, Yuteke sent me an appeal so I was more than happy to request more art from her.

Hello Yuteke!

I'll be in your care again!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune again.

The theme is Tenka-chan wearing kigurumi pajamas!

I don't really care about the animal or color, so I'll leave those up to you.

For the scenerio and her expression, I want to create the feeling of "I just woke up so I'm still tired, and I'm rubbing my eye while holding my stuffed animal".

Thank you very much!
