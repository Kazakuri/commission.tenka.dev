Since Valentine's day was closing in, I wanted to see Tenka-chan showing off a bit of her dere side. For this request, I ended up going back to Bonyuu Cheese no Natsu because their art really is incredible and I thought that they could create an adorable lovey-dovey version of Tenka. Naturally it ended up being even better than I could have ever imagined.

{% request() %}
Bonyuu Cheese no Natsu Sensei, I'll be in your care again! This time I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune again.

Since Valentine's day is coming up soon I'd like the theme to be "Tenka-chan built up the courage to give out chocolate!"

The tsundere let here deredere side show! I think her normal outfit would be fine.

Thanks!
