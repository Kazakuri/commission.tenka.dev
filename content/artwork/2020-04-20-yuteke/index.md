Yuteke has been one of my favourite follows on Twitter recently. They made a more personal account where they speak their mind more freely and interact with their followers more, and it's just been a really fun time in general.

I wasn't quite sure if I did a good job explaining what I wanted in my request, but the final result ended up being perfect. I love the expression she's making so much and it's just a really pleasing image to look at overall. I couldn't be more happy with it.

Hello Yuteke-san!

Congratulations of graduating!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune!

In this image, a certain idiot made Tenka angry and she is pouting!

Tenka's pouty face is super adorable though, right?~

I'll leave the other details up to you.

Thank you very much!
