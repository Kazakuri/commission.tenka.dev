This image is the second installment of the Prisma Illya themed Tenka illustrations I've been requesting through Skeb and I'm rather estastic with how incredible these have been turning out. I've been a huge fan of nasii's Illya images for a while now so I trusted them completely to make Tenka look absolutely adorable.

There's not really anything about the result that jumps out to me as "this detail in particular is fantastic", it's just a really solid image overall and I'm incredibly happy with it. I've been looking into getting some prints of all my commissions and the final image is a little bit on the smaller side for that. It's not that big of a deal to me though and I'm not bothered by it at all, but it's something I'll have to consider and play with a bit when the time comes.

Nice to meet you, nasii!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune!

For this image, Tenka is wearing Illya's magical girl outfit!

I'd be really happy if you could draw her in a cute pose.

Thank you very much!
