This was the first commission that I’ve ever done and I couldn’t have been more happy with it. The expression on Tenka is adorable and I’ve definitely caught myself getting distracted staring at it for too long.

They spent a week making a sketch of the request and a similar amount of time going from the sketch to the full illustration. They’ve raised their prices a bit since I commissioned them, but I’d still happily commission Kaxukin again. Going by the quality of work I received, I think they can double or triple their current price with no problems.

The character is Tenka Adachi (足立 甜花) from the visual novel / hentai animation Shoujo Ramune (小女ラムネ).

I've collected a few screenshots of her [here](https://imgur.com/a/aql1JnX).

For the image, I'd prefer the design to be more towards the VN's style with her giving a peace sign in an idol-like pose like she was posing for a photo.

Something similar to [this](https://pixiv.net/member_illust.php?illust_id=57019470&mode=medium), just with her being more confident / less shy.

Another example of a good expression would be [this image](https://pixiv.net/member_illust.php?illust_id=58969295&mode=medium).

I'm definitely not the best at explaining things so if you need more to go off of or have any other questions then feel free to ask away ^^
