One of my absolute favourite types of illustrations are skin tight swimsuits, and Tsuchimiya is easily up there as a contender for the king of swimsuits. All of their art is amazing, but I'm a huge fan of the way they draw stomaches and water droplets in particular.

I was ecstatic that they were willing to draw Tenka in a school swimsuit, since they normally draw girls in competition swimsuits. Though in the end they did provide competition swimsuit version as a bonus which was a welcome surprise. The lower half of the half of the image is wonderful with all the drops of water running down the swimsuit and her legs.

Nice to meet you, Tsuchimiya!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

In the image Tenka-chan is sitting poolside wearing a school swimsuit.

I'll leave the other details up to you.

Thank you very much!
