I actually ended up feeling really bad after sending this request because I realized that I forgot to attach a reference album for this request. It's fairly easy to not include one since the dedicated field to put a reference URL into doesn't appear unless you first type something like うちの子, URL, http, ref, ツイート, or 参考 into the message body of the request. Additionally, I accidentally marked the request as NSFW without even realizing it, so I probably ended up causing a bit a confusion for Menbow...

When I woke up and saw the delivery on Skeb I was taken by complete surprise. I already love Menbow's distinct style, but getting to see Tenka drawn in that style is like a dream come true. Particularily I really love how the lighting was setup with a ton of shading on her outfit as well as the highlights in her hair.

Menbow-san, hello!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune!

The theme of this illustration is "A festival date with Tenka-chan!"

In the anime Tenka did end up wearing a kimono, so I think that or any other design would be good.

If you can, I'd like to have it with a festival ongoing in the background, but otherwise just a normal white background is fine!

It would be nice if you could add in some other traditional goods from Japanese festivals as well. For example, things like a candy apple or a yoyo balloon.

I'll leave the choice of that and other small details up to you.

Thank you very much!
