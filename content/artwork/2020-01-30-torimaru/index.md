I discovered Torimaru's art through Skeb and immediately fell in love with the panties and skin they draw. This is the most I've paid for a commission to date, but the result was more than worth it. Torimaru captured the feeling I was going for exactly and drew such an amazing image.

A newly introduced feature of Skeb lets you choose between either a 30/60 or 7/90 day acceptance and delivery requirement. I tried out the new 7/90 option, but it didn’t make any difference since they only took around 3 weeks to complete the request. I see how the longer delivery period could be useful for artists who often get busy in their work.

Hello Torimaru-san!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

In the image she's changing into an idol costume while in a pose than emphasises her ass. Since she is being seen while changing I think her being shy and flustered would make for a good expression.

Thank you very much!
