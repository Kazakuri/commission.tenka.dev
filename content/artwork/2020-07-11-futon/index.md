I’ve mentioned it a few times recently, but I’ve been defaulting to leaving the theme of my requests up to the artist a lot more. I’m always interested to see how the artist researches Shoujo Ramune, more so when the artist sends me an appeal. I have requested Tenka in her summer yukata before, but it surprised me that Futon drew her wearing it.

Futon’s art-style isn’t the style of art that I usually look for, but I can appreciate its beauty either way. I love the way this commission turned out. The fireworks in the background plus the wonderful expression on her face create the wonderful atmosphere of a summer festival date.

Nice to meet you, Futon!

Thank you for the appeal!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

I'll leave the theme up to you.

Thank you very much!
