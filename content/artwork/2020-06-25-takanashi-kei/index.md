Kei is another one of those artists that when I came across their Skeb profile, I found it impossible to resist sending a request because of how much I love their art. When looking through their past requests, all the cute tummies inspired me, but I really loved the way the post-workout Amatsukaze turned out, so I wanted to see Tenka in a similar situation. The first time I looked at the result, I struggled to find the words to express how amazing it is, and I still don’t know if I can express myself properly. It’s an amazing image and I love it so much.

I’ve always enjoyed illustrations of anime girls during or just after a workout, and last year Doga Kobo re-ignited that passion for many people with their adaption of “How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?”. Overall, I think clothing like spats and other skin-tight items look incredible, especially when they give off a nice shine.

Nice to meet you, Takanashi Kei!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

After a workout, Tenka-chan is taking a break and is sweating a bit.

For her outfit, I think that spats and a sports bra would be good.

Focusing a bit on her navel and tummy would also be good.

I'll leave the other details up to you.

Thank you very much!
