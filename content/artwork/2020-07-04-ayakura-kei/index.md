Maid outfits are another one of those cliche outfits that anime fans love seeing their favourite characters in, so it’s only natural that I’d eventually commission Tenka wearing one. Since I only requested the maid outfit, Ayakura had control over most of the details. Reflecting on it, I should have offered more money to request a setting where she’s serving a customer at a maid cafe. The image itself is still super adorable, so I’m not upset that I didn’t end up requesting a setting or anything.

I don’t really care about having my name my on the requests or not, but it is nice to see some of the handwritten messages. Especially when the artist puts their signature on the art. I was a little disappointed that I didn’t get a signature like that, since a few of their earlier requests had them. It usually makes me think something like “the character is from a hentai visual novel, so she’s not well known and it’s hard to get inspired.”  It’s easy for me to rationalise with that, since I usually mull over the same thing and feel anxious before sending requests.

Nice to meet you, Ayakura!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

In the image, Tenka-chan is wearing a maid outfit!

I'll leave the other details up to you.

Thank you very much!
