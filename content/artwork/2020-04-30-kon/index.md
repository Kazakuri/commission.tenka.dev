Kon has a really unique artstyle and always draws a ton of really adorable kemonomimi art. By the time I sent this request I had already requested art of a catgirl Tenka and I didn't want to repeat a theme so soon, so I left the theme up to Kon. In any case, I was able to see their rendition of Tenka-chan and I'm really happy with the result.

I love the choice of colours used in the background and how well it works in constrast to Tenka out in front. Tenka herself is as adorable as always, though I can't help but notice there seems to be something missing underneath her shorts.

Hello Kyukon!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune in your style.

I'll leave the theme up to you.

Thank you very much!
