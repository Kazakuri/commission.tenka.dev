For this commission, I got to beÂ their first ever request through Skeb, which has been something I've wanted to do since starting my adventure there. One thing I wasn't sure of was what to expect in terms of differences in their style between Pixiv and Skeb, because of things like the price they charge and their passion for the characters. It wouldn't have been the first time I've seen something like that, so I got worried about going into it. The result I got was exactly what I expected compared to their normal illustrations on Pixiv though, so I was worrying over nothing.

One more thing I wanted to mention with this request is that after the fact, they posted about it on their Pixiv Fanbox [here](https://www.pixiv.net/fanbox/creator/32916/post/846542). The post starts by talking about how they were interest in Skeb and wanted to try it out, so getting a request so quickly made them happy and about how nervous they were doing the drawing. They continue on by talking about how they were struggling a bit with drawing such a small character and were wondering if it turned out okay, since they can't really view it objectively themselves until a few months after the fact. After that, they talked about things like health, money, and computer mice for a bit and it was overall just an enjoyable read and I'm happy that I could learn a bit about them and their story. I follow something like 1,400 people on Pixiv so it's sometimes very easy to end up forgetting about the person behind the artist's name, so I really enjoy getting to experience these kinds of things.

Mizuho Como-san, welcome to Skeb!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune!

I'd be happy if you could draw her and give off the feeling of "having fun at the beach"!

There is an official swimsuit for her in the series, but any other cute swimsuit would be fine too.

Thank you very much!
