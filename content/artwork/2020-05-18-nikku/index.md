Skirt lifting (たくし上げ) is one of my favourite tags to look at on Pixiv, so getting to see Tenka take on that pose will always be a treat. I did feel a little bit bad for this request, since Nikku always draws R18 art and while this is still pretty lewd, it's not quite at the same level as his usual art.

I was actually quite surprised at the result of this request, because instead of doing a normal "lift the skirt to show the panties", he decided to go with "lift the skirt just enough to show that she's not wearing panties, but not to reveal too much". 

The other thing that took me surprise was how familiar the background scenery felt to me. It's the same setting as the first scene of episode 2 of the OVA, where Tenka is underneath the bridge with Oji-san after her photo shoot. When Tweeting about the Skeb request, Nikku wrote that he had played the game so he had a bit of an emotional connection to the request.

Nice to meet you, Nikku!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

In the image, Tenka-chan has an embarrassed look on her face as she lifts up her skirt.

I'll leave the other details up to you.

Thank you very much!
