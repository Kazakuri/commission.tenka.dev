I don’t even know where to begin with describing this request… It’s just way too perfect. I’ve owned the dakimakura that has Tenka wearing this outfit for quite some time now, but I recently got my hands on the drama CD. There’s a strong chance I end up requesting a lot more art of Tenka wearing this because I love the outfit way too much.

The only thing that took me by surprise is how short Otsukue drew Tenka’s tank top. Since the original imagery only has the tank top rolled up past her chest, they mostly leave the length up to the viewer’s imagination. I’ve always thought of it as normal a length one, but I see how it looks shorter after looking at the pillow again.

Nice to meet you, Otsukue!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

For this illustration, Tenka-chan is lifting up her skirt so you can see her panties!

The outfit is the special outfit she wore in her special dakimakura release. I've taken a picture to the URL below.

It's my favourite outfit from Shoujo Ramune, so it's a bit of a shame that it has only been used twice...

I'll leave the other details up to you.

Thank you very much!
