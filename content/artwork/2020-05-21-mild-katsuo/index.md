Back in April 2020, I turned on Skeb's appeal feature and made my pinned Tweet on Twitter a call for appeals, since I figured it'd be a good way to find new creators. 

I received this particular appeal as I was preparing to go to bed and sent the request through Skeb after 22 minutes, 5 minutes later the request was approved. I laughed at how efficient it seemed, but the joke was apparently on me because the request was completed by the time I woke up in the morning.

I try to browse the "New Creator" section on Skeb a lot, but it can get pretty overwhelming since it's usually a few clicks to visit their Twitter or Pixiv to view art samples. Skeb's appeal feature helps out a bit by letting creators spin that in the opposite direction too. Without it turned on, there's a good chance I would have never come across Mild Katsuo's profile and gotten a cute Tenka illustration out of it.

Nice to meet you, Mild Katsuo!

Thank you for the appeal!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

I'll leave the theme up to you.

Thank you very much!
