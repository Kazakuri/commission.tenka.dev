I really ended up embracing the full spirit of Skeb with this request since the creator has something along of the lines of "please only make requests with a character name" in their Twitter bio, so everything else was left completely up to the artist.

I absolutely love Ame's art style and the image turned out really nicely. In particular I really like how the hair turned out and the look of her left hand. The way that she's leaning forward make her butt seem a bit weird at first glance but looking at it now it's completely fine and I like the way it turned out.
