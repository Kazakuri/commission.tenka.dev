This commission from Coyomin was a very spur-of-the-moment request, another artist I follow on Twitter retweeted their Tweet about looking for Skeb requests and I discovered them and immediately requested something.

By this point I've been able to experience Tenka being drawn in so many different styles but getting to see a new one still is an incredible experience for me. Despite being in such a suggestive outfit in such a suggestive pose, Tenka still manages to look absolutely adorable and I keep going back to look at that smile again and again.

Coyomin-san, hello!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune!

In the image, Tenka is in a white bunnysuit and tying her hair up into a sidetail with her armpits exposed!

I think a confident expression would work well for this image.

Thank you very much!
