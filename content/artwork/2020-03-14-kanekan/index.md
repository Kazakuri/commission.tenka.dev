Kanekan has always drawn some of my favourite 「おしっこ我慢」(pee holding) artwork, so getting to see his take on Tenka has been a real treat to me. I think that the slightly flustered and nervous expression captures the situation perfectly with the little bead of sweat running down her cheek. When I was explaining what I wanted in the request, I wasn't sure if I was explaining it correctly since the details of the pose aren't really common phrases that you'd be using a lot in Japanese, but Kanekan was able to figure out what I was asking and made it look fantastic!

Nice to meet you, Kanekan!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune!

The theme of this illustration is "Somehow I'm holding it in. I really need to use the bathroom"!

For the pose, it'd be nice if she was holding onto the front of her skirt with a slightly embarrassed look.

I'll leave the other details up to you.

I uploaded some screenshots of her below.

If you could draw that for me I'd be very happy!

Thank you very much!
