Kanekan’s illustrations are all very cute, but his “pee-holding” illustrations are some of my favourite. Tenka-chan is a character that I think fits his style well, so I was excited to see what he would draw! The slightly flustered and nervous expression does a perfect job of capturing the situation, especially with the little bead of sweat running down her cheek. The pose isn’t something that you’d often explain in Japanese so I didn’t know if I explained it right, but Kanekan figured out what I was asking and made fantastic looking result!

Nice to meet you, Kanekan!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune!

The theme of this illustration is "Somehow I'm holding it in. I really need to use the bathroom"!

For the pose, it'd be nice if she was holding onto the front of her skirt with a slightly embarrassed look.

I'll leave the other details up to you.

I uploaded some screenshots of her below.

If you could draw that for me I'd be very happy!

Thank you very much!
