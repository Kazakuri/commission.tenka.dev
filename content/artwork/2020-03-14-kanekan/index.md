Kanekan has always drawn some of my favourite 「おしっこ我慢」 (holding in the urge to pee) artwork, so getting to see his take on Tenka has been a treat to me. I think the slight flustered and nervous expression does a perfect job of capturing the situation with the little bead of sweat running down her cheek. When I explained what I wanted in the request, I wasn't sure if I explained everything correctly since the details of the pose aren't common phrases that you'd be using a lot in Japanese, but Kanekan figured out what I was asking and made fantastic looking result!

Nice to meet you, Kanekan!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune!

The theme of this illustration is "Somehow I'm holding it in. I really need to use the bathroom"!

For the pose, it'd be nice if she was holding onto the front of her skirt with a slightly embarrassed look.

I'll leave the other details up to you.

I uploaded some screenshots of her below.

If you could draw that for me I'd be very happy!

Thank you very much!
