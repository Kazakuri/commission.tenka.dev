I discovered Sekina's art while browsing through Skeb's most recently completed requests feed and immediately fell in love with their art. Their request page mentioned that they preferred lesser detail so I decided to let them have full control over the theme of the illustration. I've always been a little bit apprehensive when making requests like that, but I figured that since all their art is really fantastic and that's their preference the small amount of nerves would be worth it.

When I first received the delivery notification and opened it up, I had no idea what to say. I was completely speechless over how incredible this illustration is. Even after sitting on it for a day I still keep going back to marvel at it some more. I never knew just how badly I wanted to see Tenka eat a popsicle until I saw it.

The background and lighting effects on the image are perfect and Tenka looks adorable as always. I absolutely can't wait to print this one out and hang it on my wall.

Nice to meet you, Sekina!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

I'll leave the theme up to you.

Thank you very much!
