My adventures towards finding cute outfits for Tenka to wear has moved on from the Prisma Illya universe to now include the wonderful world of boat girls!

Shimakaze has one of the really famous outfits that a ton of anime fans will recognize instantly, and since Tiemu draws a ton of adorable art of Shimakaze, it's like a match made in heaven.

There's a lot love about this image, the pose is really cute and the outfit looks incredible. I think I'm most excited about how the pose gives me a nice peek at Tenka's tummy.

Nice to meet you, Tiemu!

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

In the image, Tenka-chan is cosplaying as Shimakaze-chan!

I'll leave the pose and other details up to you.

Thank you very much!
