In the three days it took for Inami to complete the commission after sending the appeal, I had already received two more appeals! I’ve climbed into the top 50 requesters on Skeb since the last time I received an appeal, but I’m guessing I’ll receive even more while I climb to the top ranks. Appeals are a great way for me to discover new creators with wonderful art styles, so I love receiving them.

Inami posts a lot of artwork with frills and ribbons on her Pixiv, so I decided on requesting an outfit that was more girly and frilly than what Tenka-chan normally wears. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was more than pleased with it. I could imagine the outfit being something that an idol would wear on stage when performing.

Nice to meet you, Inami!

Thank you for the appeal!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

For her outfit, I want her to be wearing an elegant and frilly dress!

I don't have anything in mind for the specifics or the outfit or pose, so I'll leave the other details up to you.

Thank you very much!
