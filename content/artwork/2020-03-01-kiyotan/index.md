This was the first time that I've commissioned someone where I didn't have a specific idea or theme that I wanted them to draw in mind. The entire experience left me a little impatient and curious, wondering about how they'd draw Tenka. Kiyo has always drawn a ton of incredible GochiUsa art and even their Chino-inspired original character is super adorable, so I had no concerns about not liking the result of the commission or anything like that.

This was also the second time that I could be an artist's first request through Skeb and just like the last time, I ended up being more than happy with the image. The level of detail in the image took me by surprise. Everything from the lens flare to the depth of field on the hair alongside a fantastic-looking background is incredible. Throw an adorable pair of panties and I'm finding it hard to look away.

Kiyozou-san, nice to meet you!

Welcome to Skeb!

Please draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune!

I love all of illustrations so much, so I'll leave the theme and everything else up to you.

Thank you very much!
