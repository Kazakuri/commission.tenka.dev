At the time I initially made the request, I saw that their Twitter bio said they were dreaming of the day that someone would call them "sensei", so I figured I'd be a bit cheeky and address them as sensei in my request. I hope they enjoyed it!The finished commission is super adorable, I love the artist’s style and there are a bunch of minor things to appreciate in the illustration. The slight swing in her hips with the lifted skirt creates the perfect tease to just barely keep her covered, and I particularly enjoy the way her hands turned out.

Lemono Lemone-sensei, hello.

If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune!

For the pose I'd like if she was showing off a pair of her panties cat's cradle style in front of her.

I think in this situation it'd be good for her to still wear a skirt, since I don't really want her to show off her lewd places.

The expression should be as if she was thinking "This is so embarrasing that I could die! Baka hentai!"

Things like the colour of the panties or whether or not the panties are stained don't matter to me so I'll leave those kinds of details up to you!

I would be really happy if you could draw that.

Thank you so much!
