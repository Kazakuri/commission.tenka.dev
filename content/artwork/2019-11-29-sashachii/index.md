With Christmas coming up, I forced myself to break my commission anxiety to get a festive image of Tenka made to use for the holidays. Sasha's art-style is clean and the blush on Tenka is wonderful. It's a shame that I crop off the lower half of the image when using it as an avatar though, because the artist drew her with such an adorable tummy.

The sketch took a week to finish and just two days later the image was complete! The price for the commission was more than reasonable, especially considering how satisfied I am with it.

Hey there! Since Christmas is coming up I'm looking to commission an image of my favourite character wearing something more festive to use as a profile picture on Twitter and a few other sites.

The character is Tenka Adachi (足立甜花) from the visual novel / hentai animation Shoujo Ramune (小女ラムネ). I've collected a few screenshots (all SFW) of her [here](https://imgur.com/a/aql1JnX).

I'm not too fixated on anything specific for her outfit or pose, but it'd be great to have her in a more playful/teasing style. I think a pose similar to [this one](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/66437121) would be great.

Outfit-wise I don't think you can really go wrong with a classic santa hat. It might even be possible to sneak in her pink cube hair accessory along the white trim at the bottom, sort of like the bows in the art I linked above.  
Other than that, a fairly simple outfit would be more than good enough. Maybe something like [this](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/54253372) that can show off her tummy a bit.

I'm not the best at explaining things so if you need more to go off of or have any other questions then please feel free to ask away ^^
