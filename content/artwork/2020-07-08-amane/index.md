Recently I’ve been receiving a bunch of appeals from new or more unknown creators. It’s most likely because I’m close to the top of the “Request Master” list, but it always makes me happy seeing creators show interest in drawing Tenka. When I look into the creator’s profile and see that their art doesn’t suit Tenka and her features I feel bad about having to ignore the appeal, but getting the chance to discover new artists like Amane makes it feel worthwhile. 

In the appeal message, Amane mentioned that they usually draw girls with larger chests, but they were also fine drawing smaller girls too. I’m not sure if that’s just a part of their usual appeal message, or it was because they noticed the kinds of images I usually requested, but things like that help a lot when I’m thinking about their appeal. The image itself is incredible. I wasn’t sure if I was properly conveying myself by describing it as a naked ribbon, but the ribbons around her chest and lower half are fantastic, and the bow wrapping around her wrists binding them together is a wonderful touch. I would love to receive this Tenka as a present.

Nice to meet you, Amane!

Thank you for the appeal!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

The theme of the image is a naked ribbon!

Tenka-chan is offering herself wearing just a ribbon as a present for me! I think she'd look good with an embarrased look on her face.

I'll leave the other details up to you.

Thank you very much!
