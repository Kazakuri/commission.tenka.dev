Natsu no Koucha draws a ton of adorable loli characters and after discovering them on Skeb, I just knew I had to send them a request. Taking erotic selfies is something I always love seeing in illustrations, and the extra unease that go in to a character’s first attempts will always make it even more enjoyable.

I really enjoy how Natsu provided the camera’s view as a variation, but it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity not to use camera UI as censoring. Regardless of that, I really love the pose used, especially with how her hair drapes up against the pillow behind her.

Nice to meet you, Natsu no Koucha!

I'd like to ask you to draw Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune.

In the image, Tenka-chan is taking her first erotic selfie!

Please draw her with a bit of an embarrassed expression on her face!

I'll leave the other details up to you.

Thank you very much!
