There are a handful of emotes I use pretty much everyday on Discord and I wanted to create versions of them that used Tenka to share my love of her with the people I talk to often. I'm thrilled with the way the emotes turned out and they've largely replaced my other emotes in terms of usage.

It took around 2 weeks for Crika to deliver the emotes, although I never received a sketch first like the description stated. Not receiving a sketch isn’t an enormous deal to me or anything though, especially now that I’m getting used to using Skeb more.

Hey there, I was looking to get 6 Discord emotes made.

All of the emotes are of the same character, Tenka Adachi from Shoujo Ramune. Since the source material isn't SFW, I uploaded a bunch of SFW pictures of her [here](https://imgur.com/a/aql1JnX).

The emotes I'm looking for are:
- Dabbing
- Smug
- Pouting
- Love
- Shocked / Embarrassed
- Drinking

I found a few emotes (from your samples and other Discord servers) that match what I'm looking for and uploaded them [here](https://i.imgur.com/5A8LqSU.jpg).
