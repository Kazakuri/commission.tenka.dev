## Where are the Images?

Becuase [GitHub's Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines#what-is-not-allowed) do not allow the posting sexually obscene content, all the images in the blog posts are automatically compressed.

All the original images are still accessible using the provided decompress script, but they're not directly viewable through GitHub's service, which should hopefully alleviate all community guideline concerns.
